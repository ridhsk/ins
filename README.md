\# **INFORMATION AND NETWORK SECURITY**

## **ABOUT**
**This repository contains implementations of various classical encryption techniques used in Information and Network Security. These algorithms are fundamental in cryptography and help in securing communication by encrypting sensitive information.**  

## **DIRECTORIES**
Each directory contains a specific encryption algorithm, along with source code and explanations.

### **1. Caesar_Cipher**
**- A simple substitution cipher that shifts characters by a fixed number.**  
**- One of the earliest encryption techniques.**  

### **2. DES (Data Encryption Standard)**
**- A symmetric key algorithm used for encrypting data.**  
**- Operates on 64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key.**  

### **3. Fiestal_Cipher**
**- A structure used in many modern encryption algorithms.**  
**- Forms the basis of block ciphers like DES.**  

### **4. Hill_Cipher**
**- A polygraphic substitution cipher using matrix multiplication.**  
**- Uses linear algebra for encryption and decryption.**  

### **5. Playfair_Cipher**
**- A digraph substitution cipher using a 5x5 matrix.**  
**- More secure than simple monoalphabetic ciphers.**  

### **6. Vigenere_Cipher**
**- A polyalphabetic cipher that uses a repeating key.**  
**- Provides stronger encryption than the Caesar Cipher.**  

### **7. Monoalphabetic Cipher**
**- A substitution cipher where each letter is replaced with a unique different letter.**  
**- Offers more security than a simple shift cipher.**
